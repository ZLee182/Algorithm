题目要求：

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example:

n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.

思路详解：

二分查找，重点是mid = low+(high-low)/2；如果用mid = (low+high)/2 容易溢出。

答案详解：

// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1,high = n;
        int mid;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            mid = (high-low)/2+low;
            if(guess(mid)==0)
                return mid;
            else if(guess(mid)>0)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid -1;
        }
    }
};
